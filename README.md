# Oqtane.LicensedModule

Oqtane is a CMS and app framework which can be extended with additional modules and themes. Extensions which are developed as off-the-shelf products by ISVs are available through the [Oqtane Marketplace](https://www.oqtane.net). Extensions can be offered under either an open source license or commercial license. Commercial extensions will need to include a licensing capability to restrict access to authorized users. Developers can utilize their own licensing solution within their extensions, or they can take advantage of the integrated licensing solution which is included with the Oqtane Framework. 

This repo provides an example of a simplistic commercial module which utilizes the integrated licensing solution.
